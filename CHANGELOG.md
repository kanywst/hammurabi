* **site:** the palette tokens are replaced. carve/bronze/lapis/gold/ hairline/stone are gone; field/relief/rule/rubric take their place.
* **codex:** content/en.md, translations/jp.md and README.jp.md are gone. The English codex is README.md, the Japanese one is translations/ja.md, and both are generated. Site fragment links of the form #law-NN no longer resolve; the replacement is /laws/<slug>/.
